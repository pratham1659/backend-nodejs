## Chapter 1 - Introduction to Node, NPM, Package.JSON

### [Chapter 1 Notes]

- **Node JS** installation from official site nodejs.org - use only LTS versions
- Use **terminal / command prompt** to check installation :

```
  node -v
  npm -v
```

- Use VS code terminal to run **commands**
- **Node REPL** interface can be used directly by typing `node` in **terminal / command prompt** . Use **Ctrl+D** to exit interface. Use **CTRL+C** to exit terminal
- Running any JavaScript file from node using `node filename.js`
- **Modules** are basic containers in Node/JavaScript system. 1 file can be one module in Javascript.
- Two type of Module Systems in node JS are - **CommonJS** module and **ES** Modules.

**- CommonJS Module**

```javascript
//lib.js
exports.sum = function () {};

//index.js
const module = require("./lib.js");
module.sum();
```

**- ES Module**

```javascript
//lib.js
export { sum };

//index.js
import { sum } from "./lib.js";
```

- FileSystem Module(fs) is one of core modules of Node JS. **fs** can be used to read/write any file. There are many more core modules in NodeJS which you can check in NodeJS API docs.
- Reading files can be **Synchronous** or **Asynchronous**. **Async** is most preferred method in NodeJS. As there is **NO blocking of I/O in NodeJS**

- Node project can be initialized with `npm init` command which also creates `package.json` file
- **package.json** is a configuration file for node projects which has **scripts**, **dependencies**, **devDependencies** etc
- `npm install <package-name>` is used to install any online modules available for node on NPM repository online.
- `nodemon` is a package for running node server and track live changes to re-start again.

```
npm install nodemon
```

- `scripts` inside **package.json** can be used like `npm run <script-name>` e.g `npm run start`, `npm run dev`. Only for `npm start` you can avoid `run`.

```
//package.json file
"scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "dev": "nodemon index.js",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
```

- use `npm install -g <package.json>` to install packages globally on your system. Not just in the project but useful all over your system.

- Node versions are formatted like **^22.12.0** where these are `major.minor.patch` versions.

- `*` This can be used to change the `major` version
- `^` This can be used to change the `minor` version
- `~` This can be used to change the `patch` version only.

- you can install all dependencies again using `npm install` again
- **package-lock.json** has exact versions installed and link of dependencies of each package.
- use `npm update` to update packages safely. `npm outdated` shows outdated and latets versions of packages installed in your **package.json**
- use `npm uninstall <package-name>` to uninstall packages from `package.json`
- `node_modules` should not be shared - you can make `.gitignore`to ignore them to be uploaded.
- `npm outdated` can used to check the outdated packages

### [Assignments ]

- **Assignment 1** : If we delete `node_modules`. How to run our application again successfully ?
- **Assignment 2** : How to use command line arguments in Node JS. Like `node index.js 3 2` - how can I get 3 and 2 to be used in my programs. [ *Hint : search for command line arguments in node* ]
- **Assignment 3** : Explore the `os` module in Node Js from their documentation. What all info you can access from it about your operating system ?
- **Assignment 4** : Explore about **Asynchronous** nature of JS as a single threaded language and how it is achieved using **Event Loop**. Video are given below in related videos sections.
- **Assignment 5 [Challenge]** : Can you run a system command from Node JS javascript file e.g. `ls` `dir` commands ? and can you store its output in a text file ?

## Chapter 2 - Server Concepts with Node - http module

### [[Chapter 2 Notes]]

#### HTTP requests

Request object comprises of many properties, but important ones are :

- **Type of Request** : GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc.
- **Headers** : Meta data sent by your browser like browser name, cookies, authentication information etc.
- **Query Parameters** (url?`name=john`) : This is used in GET requests to send data to server
- **Route Params** (url/`john`)
- **Body data** : This is used in POST and other requests to send data to server

#### HTTP responses

Response object comprises of many properties, but important ones are :

- **Headers** : Meta data sent by your server back to client like server name, content size, last updated time etc.
- **Response status code** (`200`, `404`, `403`, `502`)
- **Response body** : Actual data to be sent to client : HTML, JS, JSON, CSS, Image etc.

#### More info

- HTTP requests and responses can be tracked from **Dev Tools** > **Network Tab**
- In Node, we can use core **http** module to create a Server which listens to requests, modify data in-between and provides responses. Server needs a **PORT** to be bound to - use only port number > 1024.
- Server can simply be said as **a function which receives a request and returns a response**. [ This is just for understanding]
- There are many **Headers** which exists on request and responses - shared a link below with list of existing headers.

- We can use Server to do 3 things:

  - **Static file Hosting** : Sending normal files without formatting or modifying.
  - **Server Side Rendering** : Mixing data with templates and rendering dynamic views (dynamic web pages)
  - **Web APIs** : Sending data via some APIs/ endpoints.

- Every Request has one and only one response. If there is more than 1 response which you want to send - you will encounter a error - "_Headers already sent_"
- POSTMAN is a software for doing complex API requests.

### [[Assignments]]

- **Assignment 1** : Capture the request which goes when you like a post on facebook (using Chrome network). What are the headers ? What is the payload ?
- **Assignment 2** : In the chapter we developed a server with only URL switch, but you have to make that more efficient by making it check both METHOD (GET,POST) + URL path
  - So output of a request with **GET /demo** will be different from **POST /demo** [ Use POSTMAN for requests]
- **Assignment 3 [Challenge]** : Try and run 2 different server using the same code you have `index.js`. You will need to use 2 different ports. But can you do it using the same file and changing PORTS dynamically somehow ?
- **Assignment 4 [Challenge]** : You can also send some data to server using /demo?product=123. where product=123 is called **query parameters**. Can you capture that data and make the product page work according to the ID (123) . [ This we will do in next chapters using express, but you can give it a try ]
